# Web machine recovery (app-modulo)

Runbook for the 2026-09-02 incident class: the production web machine of
`app-modulo` (process group `app`) stays alive (state `started`) but wedged -
its HTTP server on port 8080 stops answering, and the Fly service check
`servicecheck-00-http-8080` goes critical and stays critical until the machine
is restarted.

## Symptoms

- Requests to app.modulo.run time out.
- `flyctl checks list -a app-modulo` shows `servicecheck-00-http-8080`
  critical with output like "context deadline exceeded".
- Fly proxy logs show "could not find a good candidate within 40 attempts at
  load balancing".
- `flyctl machines list -a app-modulo` still shows the `app` process-group
  machine in state `started`.

The machine being `started` is the key discriminator: this is a live-but-wedged
machine, NOT a stopped-machine outage. `fly machines start` is the wrong tool
here - the machine needs a restart.

## Diagnose (read-only)

```sh
# Service-check status: expect servicecheck-00-http-8080 critical.
flyctl checks list -a app-modulo

# Machine states and process groups: the app machine should be `started`.
flyctl machines list -a app-modulo

# Recent logs: worker machines keep logging actively while the app machine's
# service check fails - that split (workers alive, web check critical) is the
# signature of a wedge rather than a crash.
flyctl logs -a app-modulo --no-tail
```

## Recover

1. Identify the machine in the `app` process group:

   ```sh
   flyctl machines list -a app-modulo
   ```

   Note the ID from the row whose PROCESS GROUP column is `app`.

2. Restart it (brief downtime; see Notes below):

   ```sh
   flyctl machine restart <machine-id> -a app-modulo
   ```

3. Verify recovery:

   ```sh
   # Service check back to passing:
   flyctl checks list -a app-modulo

   # Site returns HTTP 200:
   curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://app.modulo.run
   ```

## Notes

- Restarting the `app` machine is safe for running pipelines: pipeline runs
  (SAQ) execute on the separate worker-process machines, which the restart
  does not touch.
- When this procedure is needed, the web server is by definition already
  unresponsive, so in-flight HTTP requests are already dead; the restart
  cannot make that worse.
- A scheduled watchdog workflow (the web-watchdog workflow) restarts the
  machine automatically when the service check stays critical past its
  guards. This runbook is the manual fallback for when the watchdog has not
  fired or is itself unavailable.
- VM sizing in `fly.toml` (`[[vm]]`) applies to NEW machines only. Resizing
  the LIVE machine takes an explicit update (brief restart):

  ```sh
  flyctl machine update <machine-id> -a app-modulo --vm-size shared-cpu-4x
  ```

  Find the app-group machine id via `flyctl machines list -a app-modulo`.
  This matches the machine-budget comment block in `fly.toml`.
