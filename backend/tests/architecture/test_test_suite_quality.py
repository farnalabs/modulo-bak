"""Architecture test: QA lenses over the test suite.

The tests in this file apply the same AST-scanning discipline the rest of
``tests/architecture/`` applies to ``src/modulo``, but pointed at the test
packages themselves. Each lens guards against a class of test-quality
regression that silently weakens the suite:

- always-pass/always-fail assertions (dead or inverted tests, including
  ``assert not <falsy constant>``)
- ``pytest.skip``/skip markers without a reason (undocumented silencing)
- bare ``except:`` handlers (swallow BaseException, hide KeyboardInterrupt)
- debugger remnants (``breakpoint``/``pdb``) committed by accident
- deprecated ``datetime.utcnow()`` / ``datetime.utcfromtimestamp()``
- naive ``datetime.now()`` (no timezone argument) fed into tz-aware code
- ``== True`` / ``== False`` equality on booleans (type confusion + E712)
- ``== None`` / ``!= None`` equality (identity vs. equality on singletons, E711)
- same-scope ``test_*`` redefinition (silently drops the earlier test)
- ``asyncio.run()`` nested inside ``async def`` tests (conflicts with the loop)
- ``assert`` in a ``try:`` body guarded by a swallowing ``except Exception:``
- stray ``print()`` calls polluting CI output
- fixtures that nothing requests (dead setup code that never runs)
- ``==`` against a float literal that is not exactly representable in binary
  (``0.1``, ``0.04``, ``0.95``, ...) — precision-fragile equality that
  ``pytest.approx`` is designed to replace
- ``assert len(x) == 0`` / ``assert 0 == len(x)`` where the ``len()`` operand
  is an attribute access, subscript, call, or container literal — an
  anti-idiom that should read ``assert not x`` and trips ruff SIM101
- tautological ``len()`` comparison bounds — ``len(x) >= 0`` and friends
  compare against a bound that ``len()`` can never cross (it never returns a
  negative number), so the assertion either always passes (``>= 0``, ``> -1``,
  ``!= -1``) or always fails (``< 0``, ``<= -1``, ``== -1``) and is dead either
  way
- ``assert len(x) > 0`` / ``assert len(x) >= 1`` / ``assert len(x) != 0``
  (the non-emptiness mirror of the ``len(x) == 0`` lens) — sized containers
  are truthy exactly when non-empty, so these should read ``assert x``
- ``assert x == []`` / ``assert x == {}`` against an empty container literal —
  ``== []``/``== {}`` is the equality-based twin of the ``len() == 0`` idiom
  and should read ``assert not x`` (an empty container is falsy)
- ``assert x == ""`` / ``assert x != ""`` against an empty string literal — the
  string twin of the empty-container lens; an empty string is falsy, so these
  should read ``assert not x`` / ``assert x``
- ``assert x == ()`` / ``assert x != ()`` against an empty tuple literal — the
  tuple twin of the empty-container lens; an empty tuple is falsy, so these
  should read ``assert not x`` / ``assert x`` (``is``/``is not`` against ``()``
  is deliberately left alone because ``()`` is interned)
- hand-rolled ``try: ... raise AssertionError(...) except X: pass`` instead of
  ``pytest.raises`` (the success path is only guarded by the ``raise`` line)
- ``assert`` nested inside ``except`` handlers (a failing assert masks the
  original exception and discards its traceback context)
- no-op ``test_*`` functions whose body contains no verification at all (they
  report green even when the code under test is completely broken, as long as
  no exception escapes)
- assertions comparing two *literal constants* (``assert 1 == 1``,
  ``assert 3 > 5``, ``assert 'a' not in {'b': 1}``) — the outcome is fixed at
  source time, so the assertion either always passes (dead green) or always
  fails (unconditionally red) regardless of the behaviour under test
- ``is``/``is not`` identity comparisons against a mutable container literal
  (``assert x is []``, ``assert result is {}``, ``assert x is not {1}``) —
  list/dict/set literals are freshly allocated on every evaluation, so the
  comparison can never hold (``is``) or can never fail (``is not``) and is
  dead either way (Python 3.8+ also emits a SyntaxWarning for it)
- redundant call assertions right before the test inspects the same mock's
  recorded calls (``<mock>.calls[0]``/``<mock>.call_args[0]``) — the
  introspection access that follows already fails loudly when the call never
  happened, so the assertion is dead code that can silently drift out of sync
  with what the test actually inspects. Both spellings are covered: the
  statement form ``assert <mock>.called`` and the method-call form
  ``<mock>.assert_called()`` / ``<mock>.assert_awaited()`` (the ``_once``
  variants add the "exactly one call" guarantee and are left alone)
- membership tests against an empty container literal (``assert x in []``,
  ``assert x not in {}``, ``assert x in ()``) — an empty container can never
  contain anything, so ``in`` always FAILS and ``not in`` always PASSES no
  matter what the operand evaluates to
- ``@pytest.mark.parametrize`` with a single case in ``argvalues`` — a
  parametrize that adds no matrix coverage; indistinguishable from an ordinary
  test body and almost always a leftover from trimming the case list down
- unbounded subprocess calls — ``subprocess.run``/``Popen``/``call``/
  ``check_call``/``check_output`` without a ``timeout=`` bound, and
  ``asyncio.create_subprocess_*`` processes whose ``communicate()``/``wait()``
  is not wrapped in ``asyncio.wait_for(...)``. A child process with no bound
  can hang CI indefinitely, and the failure is opaque (the runner just stops)
  instead of surfacing a bound violation the way ``requests_without_timeout``
  already does for HTTP in ``src/modulo``.
- unbounded worker-thread joins — ``thread.join()``/``Thread.join()`` without
  a ``timeout=`` bound, the in-process sibling of the unbounded-subprocess
  hazard. A worker that deadlocks (e.g. waits on a ``Barrier`` a sibling never
  reaches, or blocks on an I/O operation that never completes) takes the whole
  test — and every test after it in the same process — down with it, and the
  failure is opaque (the runner just stops) instead of surfacing a bound
  violation. ``join(timeout=None)`` is as unbounded as an omitted keyword and
  is flagged too. ``str.join``/``os.path.join``/``Path.joinpath`` are
  deliberately not matched: those always carry the iterable/path argument, so
  an argument-less ``.join()`` call is unambiguously a thread join.
- ``assert A and B`` where every operand is a comparison — a compound boolean
  assertion that should be one ``assert`` per condition; when the conjunction
  fails, pytest reports the whole expression and cannot say which operand broke
  (``or`` conjunctions are deliberately left alone: they are the intentional
  "any of these" idiom and cannot be split without changing semantics)
- ``assert bool(x)`` / ``assert not bool(x)`` — ``bool()`` is a no-op inside an
  ``assert``, which already tests truthiness (and inverts it under ``not``);
  the wrapper adds noise without changing the outcome
- ``assert not (a == b)`` / ``assert not (a in b)`` / ``assert not (a is b)`` —
  negating a single comparison with ``not`` instead of writing the positive
  mirror (``assert a != b``, ``assert a not in b``, ``assert a is not b``).
  A ``not``-wrapped comparison reports the *negation* of a comparison in the
  failure diff, where the mirrored operator reads the intent directly; it is
  also the exact class of expression ruff's SIM201/SIM202 flags. ``not``
  applied to a ``BoolOp`` (De Morgan compound) is left alone — that is the
  intentional "none of these hold" idiom.
- ``assert x == set()`` / ``assert x != list()`` against a zero-argument
  builtin call that always produces an empty container (``list()``,
  ``dict()``, ``set()``, ``tuple()``, ``bytes()``, ``bytearray()``,
  ``frozenset()``) — the call-based twin of the ``== []``/``== {}`` literal
  lens. Every such builtin returns a falsy container, so these should read
  ``assert not x`` / ``assert x``
- ``async def test_*`` functions whose body contains *no* async construct at
  all — no ``await``, no ``async with``, no ``async for``, no ``yield``. An
  async test that never suspends runs plain synchronous code on the event
  loop for no reason, and the coroutine boundary is a silent-false-green
  hazard: anyone who later calls an ``async`` function and forgets the
  ``await`` will find the assertion comparing against a coroutine object
  (always truthy) instead of failing. Declare such tests as a plain ``def``.
- ``async def`` fixtures whose body contains *no* async construct — the
  fixture twin of the needlessly-async-test lens. The coroutine boundary is
  the same silent-false-green hazard (a forgotten ``await`` silently builds
  the fixture from a coroutine object instead of failing), and a sync
  fixture is requested the same way by async tests, so declare these as a
  plain ``def``. Unlike the test lens, a ``pass``-only body is flagged too —
  the no-op-test lens skips fixtures, so nothing else covers it.
- ``@pytest.mark.parametrize`` with an *empty* ``argvalues`` — the inverse
  twin of the single-case lens. A parametrize with zero cases is collected as
  zero test items, so the test body never runs at all: pytest emits a
  collection warning and the suite still reports green, silently dropping
  whatever regression coverage the test provided. Usually a leftover from
  deleting the last case, or an ``argvalues`` list built by code that returned
  nothing.
- ``assert isinstance(a, X) and isinstance(b, Y)`` — an ``and`` conjunction
  whose operands are all ``isinstance()`` calls is a compound boolean
  assertion: when it fails, pytest reports the whole conjunction and cannot
  say which operand had the wrong type. Split it into one ``assert`` per
  isinstance call so each failure names its own operand. A single isinstance,
  or an isinstance mixed with a truthiness/``is not None`` check (the
  deliberate "type and non-empty" idiom), is left alone
- ``@pytest.mark.parametrize`` whose declared argname is never referenced in
  the test body — the parametrize runs the body once per case but the body
  ignores the parameter, so every case exercises the *same* assertion. The
  matrix coverage is illusory: a regression in the behaviour that the
  parameter was meant to vary is caught by case 1 and reported identically
  N times, while a reader (and a mutation-testing run) believes N distinct
  inputs are covered. Drop the unused parameter (and the parametrize when
  that leaves no other varying argument)
- an async decorator on a *synchronous* ``def`` — ``@pytest.mark.asyncio`` /
  ``@pytest.mark.anyio`` on a plain ``def``, and ``@pytest_asyncio.fixture``
  on a plain ``def`` fixture. With ``asyncio_mode = auto``, pytest-asyncio
  already infers async behaviour from ``async def``, so an async marker on a
  ``def`` is a needless coroutine boundary: at best a misleading no-op (the
  body never suspends, but readers expect it to) and at worst a runtime
  mismatch (a sync fixture whose value pytest-asyncio expects to await).
  These are almost always the leftover twin of the needlessly-async
  conversion — when an ``async def`` was flipped to a plain ``def``, its
  async decorator should have gone too
- split ``assert_called_once``/``assert_awaited_once`` + ``assert_called_with``/
  ``assert_awaited_with`` pairs on the *same* mock — the two-line form is the
  split twin of the single atomic ``assert_called_once_with(...)``/
  ``assert_awaited_once_with(...)`` check. Written separately, the pair can
  silently drift out of sync (one half edited, the other not), so a reader —
  and a mutation-testing run — cannot rely on the "exactly once with these
  args" guarantee the combined form enforces in one statement. Merge the pair
  into the ``_once_with`` form

- function parameters that name a pytest *built-in fixture* (``monkeypatch``,
  ``mocker``, ``caplog``, ``capsys``, ``capfd``, ``recwarn``, ``tmp_path``,
  ``tmpdir``, ...) but are never referenced in the body — those fixtures have
  no setup side effect, so requesting one and never touching the value is
  pure dead weight that misleads readers into believing the test controls
  (say) environment state. Drop the unused parameter. ``request`` is
  deliberately not matched: pytest-bdd step functions conventionally carry it
  even when the body only reaches state through fixture names, and
  ``tmp_path_factory`` is session-scoped plumbing rather than a per-test
  capability
- ``assert a == b == c`` — an ``assert`` whose test is a *chained equality*
  comparison (a ``==`` chain with two or more operators) asserts N independent
  equalities as one expression. When the chain fails, pytest reports the whole
  chain and cannot say which link broke, so a mutation-testing run that severs
  the middle relationship (``b``) reports the same opaque failure every time.
  Split each link into its own ``assert`` so each failure names the pair that
  broke. Range checks (``assert lo <= x <= hi``) use ordering operators and
  are deliberately exempt: a bounds assertion is a single fact that reads
  naturally as a chain, so only ``==`` chains are flagged
- ``@pytest.mark.parametrize`` whose ``argvalues`` holds a *duplicate* case —
  the single-case and empty-case lenses guard the degenerate ends of the case
  list, and this lens guards the copy-paste trap in the middle: two cases with
  the *same value* run the test body twice with identical inputs, so the second
  run adds no coverage while the parametrize advertises one more distinct case
  than it exercises. A reader (and a mutation-testing run) believes N distinct
  inputs are covered when only N-1 are. The lens compares each case by value
  (after ``ast.literal_eval``), so ``1`` and ``True`` are deliberately treated
  as distinct and only byte-identical values are flagged — an unambiguous
  duplicate
- ``@pytest.mark.skipif``/``@pytest.mark.xfail`` whose *condition* is a
  statically-foldable literal (``True``, ``0``, ``[]``, a string, ...) — the
  skip outcome is decided at source time. ``skipif(True, ...)`` permanently
  deselects the test from every run (the same coverage loss as a ``@skip``
  marker, but hiding behind a "conditional" spelling that reads as
  deliberate), and ``skipif(False, ...)`` is a dead marker that never
  triggers. Both are almost always leftovers from temporarily disabling a
  test while debugging, and a reader — or a mutation-testing run — believes
  the test participates when it silently does not. The module-level
  ``pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif(...)`` form is covered too. Dynamic
  conditions (names, calls, comparisons, attributes) are left alone: those
  evaluate at collection time and are the legitimate form, and the
  skip-without-reason lens already owns the missing-``reason`` half of the
  marker
- ``pytest.raises``/``pytest.warns`` whose expected exception is a *broad*
  class — ``Exception``, ``BaseException``, or ``AssertionError`` (for
  ``raises``) without a ``match=`` narrow. ``pytest.raises(Exception)``
  catches every failure — including a regression that raises the *wrong*
  exception and the test's own assertion errors — so the test reports green
  when the behaviour it guards silently changes to raise something else;
  ``pytest.raises(BaseException)`` widens that mask to
  ``KeyboardInterrupt``/``SystemExit``. ``pytest.raises(AssertionError)``
  without ``match=`` is the sharpest form of the hazard: an *internal* assert
  bug in the code under test is swallowed as the expected exception and the
  test passes. A ``match=`` narrows the message, not the type, so it does not
  rescue the call. The same catch-all applies to ``@pytest.mark.xfail(raises=...)``
  markers, which then xfail on *any* exception. Name the specific exception
  the code is documented to raise (``ValueError``, ``KeyError``, ...); when
  the code under test is an assert-based validator that must trip, pin the
  failure with ``match=`` so the check cannot silently absorb a different
  error. Attribute-qualified classes (``pytest.skip.Exception`` /
  ``pytest.xfail.Exception``) and concrete named exceptions are left alone —
  they are the specific form this lens exists to force, and a union of
  *specific* exceptions (``(ValueError, TypeError)``) is the intentional
  "either of these" form
- ``assert <mock>.assert_*()`` / ``assert not <mock>.assert_*()`` — using a
  unittest.mock verification method *as* the assertion's test expression.
  Every ``assert_called``/``assert_called_with``/``assert_awaited*``/
  ``assert_not_called``/``assert_has_calls`` method returns ``None``, so
  ``assert mock.assert_called()`` is a typo for ``mock.assert_called()`` +
  ``assert <something>``: the assertion is ``assert None``, which ALWAYS
  FAILS even when the double verified correctly (the test is red no matter
  what the code under test does), and ``assert not mock.assert_called()`` is
  ``assert not None``, which ALWAYS PASSES regardless of the recorded calls
  (a silent false green that a mutation-testing run believes is a real
  verification). Both are almost always a leftover from inlining a bare
  ``assert`` in front of a verification call while debugging; the correct
  form is to call the verification method as its own statement — it already
  raises ``AssertionError`` on mismatch — and assert on a real mock attribute
  (``call_count``/``called``/``call_args``) for the value check. Only the
  whole-expression position is flagged: a verification call appearing inside a
  larger expression (the negation of another operand, a function argument, ...)
  is not the assertion itself and is left alone
- a freshly-constructed Mock passed as an *expected* argument to a mock
  call-assertion — ``<mock>.assert_called_with(Mock())``,
  ``assert_called_once_with(...)``, ``assert_any_call(...)``, and their awaited
  twins, in any positional or keyword argument position. The recorded call is
  whatever object the code under test actually passed, and a fresh Mock
  compares by identity (``__eq__`` defaults to ``is``), so the expected tuple
  can never equal the recorded one: the assertion always FAILS, and for
  ``assert_any_call`` fresh mocks can never match any recorded call either.
  This is the expected-argument twin of the assert-test-expression Mock lens:
  it is almost always a leftover from inlining a double while debugging.
  Configure the double and pass the configured instance (or use a bound
  name), or assert on the real expected value
- ``assert x and not x`` / ``assert x or not x`` (and the ``not``-wrapped
  twins ``assert not (x and not x)`` / ``assert not (x or not x)``) — a
  boolean assertion whose test expression joins a value with its own negation.
  An ``and`` conjunction containing a complementary pair is a contradiction
  that can never be true, so the assert ALWAYS FAILS (unconditionally red)
  no matter what the code under test does; an ``or`` disjunction containing a
  complementary pair is a tautology that is always true, so the assert ALWAYS
  PASSES (a silent false green that a mutation-testing run believes verifies
  behavior). Both shapes are dead code — the outcome is decided by the
  expression itself, never by the behaviour under test. The lens flags only
  the top-level ``BoolOp`` of the test expression (or one ``not``-wrapped),
  comparing operands by syntax so it catches attribute paths and subscripts
  too (``assert row['x'] and not row['x']``); complementary comparisons
  written with mirrored operators (``x == y or x != y``) are left alone
  because they need operator algebra rather than syntax to prove
- wall-clock sleeps with a *computed* duration — ``time.sleep(<name>)`` /
  ``asyncio.sleep(<name>)`` where the argument is a bare name rather than a
  literal constant. A duration computed from other values (a refill rate, a
  delay variable, a backoff) is a timing-contract check that depends on real
  wall-clock passage: it is slower than necessary and flakes under load, while
  the ``sleep(<literal>)`` forms are either deliberate hang-simulation
  (timeout/cancellation tests) or deliberate tiny event-loop yields
  (``sleep(0)``) and are left alone. The fix is to inject the time source the
  code under test reads — e.g. a monotonic ``clock`` callable — and advance it
  deterministically instead of sleeping
- a ``pytest.raises(...)`` / ``pytest.warns(...)`` call standing as its own
  bare expression statement — the ``RaisesContext``/``WarningsChecker``
  context manager is constructed but never entered with ``with``, so the
  exception (or warning) it claims to expect is never actually checked: the
  test passes whether the code under test raises it, raises the *wrong*
  exception, or raises nothing at all. This is the missing-``with`` twin of
  the broad-exception lens — ``pytest.raises(X)`` as a statement is a silent
  false green that the broad lens only incidentally catches when ``X`` is
  ``Exception``/``BaseException``. The deprecated functional form
  ``pytest.raises(X, func, *args)`` actually runs the check and is
  deliberately left alone; the ``with``-entered and decorator spellings are
  naturally excluded because they never appear as a bare expression statement
- ``assert x == ANY`` / ``assert x != ANY`` against ``unittest.mock.ANY`` —
  ``ANY.__eq__`` returns ``True`` for *any* value (that is what lets it match
  an expected argument inside ``assert_called_with``/``assert_awaited_with``),
  so ``== ANY`` is ALWAYS True and ``!= ANY`` is ALWAYS False regardless of
  what the other operand evaluates to: an ``assert x == ANY`` is a silent
  false green and ``assert x != ANY`` can never pass, both decided at source
  time. ``ANY`` is only meaningful where a mock framework presides over the
  comparison — pass it as the expected argument to a mock verification
  (``mock.assert_called_with(ANY)``), never compare a value to it with
  ``==``/``!=`` yourself. The membership twin is covered too: a list/tuple
  literal that *contains* ``ANY`` (``[a, ANY]``) makes ``in`` always PASS and
  ``not in`` always FAIL, because the element match short-circuits on
  ``x == ANY``
- ``test_*`` functions *nested inside another function* — pytest only
  collects module/class-level ``test_*`` functions, so a ``def test_*``
  defined inside a test (or helper) body is never collected and silently
  drops whatever regression coverage it carries without any warning. It is
  almost always an accidental indentation or a helper miscast as a test, and
  nothing in the normal run reports it — the suite just runs a few tests
  fewer than a reader believes. Hoist the nested test to module scope, or
  rename a helper that only happens to start with ``test_``. ``@pytest.mark``-
  decorated functions are covered too (same non-collection), while nested
  ``def``/``class``/``@pytest.fixture`` helpers are left alone — those are the
  legitimate local-helper spellings
- a direct mutation of the process environment made without the ``monkeypatch``
  fixture in scope — subscript set/delete on the ``os.environ`` mapping
  (``os.environ[key] = ...`` / ``del os.environ[key]`` and the
  ``from os import environ`` twin), the mutating ``environ`` methods
  (``pop``/``update``/``setdefault``/``clear`` and their ``__*__`` / pydantic
  twins), and ``os.putenv()``/``os.unsetenv()``. A test that mutates
  ``os.environ`` and never restores it leaks state into every test that runs
  afterwards, so the suite becomes order-dependent: a test can pass alone and
  silently corrupt a sibling (or be corrupted by one) in the full run.
  ``monkeypatch.setenv()``/``monkeypatch.delenv()`` restore the value at
  teardown automatically and are the pytest-blessed form — a function that
  requests ``monkeypatch`` is left alone even when it mutates ``os.environ``
  directly. Reads (``os.getenv``, ``os.environ.get``, subscript loads) and the
  module-level ``os.environ.setdefault(...)`` bootstrap (the ``conftest.py``
  pattern that pins ``DATABASE_URL`` once at import time, which is idempotent
  configuration rather than between-test leakage) are deliberately left alone

Every lens is written so it reports actionable file:line violations instead
of a bare "assert not violations", mirroring the sibling architecture tests.
