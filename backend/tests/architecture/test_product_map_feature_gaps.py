"""Architecture test: no dangling product-map feature references anywhere.

The product map lives in two layers (ADR 008 + ``docs/product-map/README.md``):

- ``frontend/src/manifest.yaml`` - the machine-readable product surface. Its ``routes``
  carry ``product_map: [feat-*]`` refs that must resolve in the ``features:`` registry
  (already enforced by ``test_product_map.py``).
- ``docs/product-map/`` - the human-readable feature graph. Each behaviour-tracker
  entry is keyed by the same ``feat-*`` id in its YAML frontmatter and covers
  infra-only surfaces (e.g. ``feat-infra-health`` for the ``/healthz`` endpoints) that
  have no UI route and are therefore absent from the manifest ``features:`` registry.
  ``docs/security/incident-response-playbook.md`` and ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` link into this
  directory.

This suite enforces the *reverse* invariant - the one that lets feature references
drift silently: every ``feat-*`` literal used anywhere in the shipped code and tests
must resolve against the product map (the manifest ``features:`` registry merged with
the ``docs/product-map/`` entry ids). A feature used in code but missing from both
layers is invisible to Remy's ``search_documentation`` indexer and to the feature graph;
a feature-graph entry that goes stale, or a documented graph path that points nowhere,
is a dangling reference.
