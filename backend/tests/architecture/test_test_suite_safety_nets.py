"""Architecture tests: safety nets that keep CI honest.

Three lenses guard against the quiet ways a test suite loses coverage:

- **Quarantine registry consistency** — every ``test_id`` in the repo-root
  ``.quarantine.yml`` must resolve to a real test file and carry the fields
  the plugin relies on. A stale entry referencing a deleted/renamed test
  silently stops protecting anything (the xfail marker never applies), which
  turns the flaky-test quarantine into a false sense of security.
- **``@awaiting-implementation`` deselection pin** — the ``-m 'not
  awaiting-implementation'`` addopts deselects every scenario tagged
  ``@awaiting-implementation`` from every run. That exclusion is deliberate
  only while the set is small and known; a newly-tagged scenario (or an
  accidentally removed tag) must fail CI so the change is a deliberate,
  reviewed decision rather than a silent weaken/strengthen of the run set.
- **Feature-file skip tags need a reason** — Gherkin ``@skip``/``@xfail``
  tags (pytest-bdd) are only self-documenting when the immediately preceding
  line explains why; the ``.py``-level skip lens in
  ``test_test_suite_quality.py`` cannot see Gherkin tags.

Every lens reports actionable file:line diagnostics instead of a bare
"assert not violations", mirroring the sibling architecture tests.
