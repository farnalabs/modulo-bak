"""Architecture test: the product map feature registry stays consistent.

``frontend/src/manifest.yaml`` declares a ``product_map`` ``feat-*`` reference
for every shipped route (per ADR 008 — Core Shared Manifest). The registry of
allowed features lives in the same file under the top-level ``features:`` map.
Remy's ``search_documentation`` tool indexes each route's ``product_map`` refs,
so a route that drops its reference (or references a feature that no longer
exists) silently shrinks what the assistant can find, while a feature that is
never referenced is dead weight in the registry.

This suite pins the invariants a healthy product map must keep:

- every route carries a non-empty ``product_map`` reference list;
- every reference resolves against the ``features:`` registry;
- every registered feature is referenced by at least one route;
- the documentation indexer surfaces ``product_map`` refs in the index it
  builds, so features are searchable end to end.
