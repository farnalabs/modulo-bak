"""Unit tests for .github/scripts/merge-queue-approve-guard.py (FAR-455).

These prove the SHA-pin TOCTOU guard:
  * merges `gh api --paginate` output correctly across multiple pages
    (the prior bash implementation failed OPEN on the >100-item path), and
  * blocks when a non-merge commit lands after the approval, while keeping the
    approval valid across merge-only head moves.
