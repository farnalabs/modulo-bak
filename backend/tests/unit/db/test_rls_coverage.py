"""Architecture test: every org-scoped table must have an RLS policy migration.

Migration 0002 enabled row-level security on the org-scoped tables that existed
at the time. Subsequent tables were repeatedly added without a matching
``ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`` migration, silently opening tenant-isolation gaps
(a 2026-07-09 security review found ~14 uncovered tables). This test collects
every table that an RLS-enabling migration touches and asserts that set covers
every ORM table carrying an ``organisation_id`` column.

A new org-scoped model added without a corresponding RLS migration will fail
this test.

Two migration styles are supported when collecting covered tables:

1. Literal DDL — ``op.execute("ALTER TABLE foo ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY")``
   (e.g. 0045_saved_views). Found by regex over the source.
2. Loop over a table tuple — ``for t in _ORG_SCOPED_TABLES: ALTER TABLE "{t}"``
   (e.g. 0002_rls_policies, 0088_rls_missing_policies). The table names live in
   module-level tuple/list constants, so we import each RLS-enabling migration
   module and read those constants. Reading the actual code constants (not the
   docstring prose) means removing a table from the tuple correctly makes this
   test fail.

    ``app.organisation_id`` setting could read every row (a silent
    cross-tenant fail-open). The migrations were tightened to a null-safe

    the stacked permissive ``rls_org_isolation_null_context`` policy and must
    contain no fail-open OR-branch text. The downgrade leg intentionally
    restores the prior fail-open form, so its scope literal is allowed to be
    fail-open — but the upgrade (strict) scope must not be.
