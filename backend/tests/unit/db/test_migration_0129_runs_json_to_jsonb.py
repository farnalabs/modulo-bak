"""Unit tests for migration 0129_runs_json_to_jsonb (FAR-403).

The migration converts seven ``runs`` columns from ``json`` to ``jsonb``. The
original version did it with seven blocking ``ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE`` statements,
each taking an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock + full-table rewrite on the hot, continually
written ``runs`` table — which hung the migration forever and wedged deploys.

These tests are **structural**: they load the migration module, pin the
``_JSON_COLUMNS`` contract (an accidental change to the target columns would
silently convert the wrong set) and assert the emitted SQL is the non-blocking,
resumable design (temp-column ADD + bounded batch UPDATE backfill) rather than
the old blocking ALTER COLUMN TYPE form. They run without a database.

Gap: there is no live-Postgres integration test for 0129 asserting the seven
columns are ``jsonb`` and that running the migration twice is a no-op. That
requires the Testcontainers integration harness (as
``backend/tests/integration/db/test_migration_0126_eval_suite.py`` does); it is
out of scope here and not run by this unit test.
