"""Hard spend ceilings — per-run and per-org.

These ceilings are a HARD stop on billable work (spec §5.1 cost controls):

- *Per-run ceiling* (``max_run_cost_cents``): a single run must never cost more
  than this. Enforced BEFORE a billable step is spawned — if the run's already
  recorded cost plus the next step's estimated cost would exceed the ceiling,
  the run is halted rather than spawning further LLM / E2B calls.
- *Per-org ceiling* (``spend_ceiling_cents``): the organisation's lifetime
  budget. Enforced against ``organisations.org_cumulative_spend_cents`` (the
  running consumed total) — when the remaining budget would be exhausted the
  run is halted before any new billable step.

Both values are stored in integer CENTS to avoid floating-point drift in the
limit comparison (the same discipline as the daily ledger's ``Decimal`` column,
but kept as ints so the gate comparison is exact and allocation-free).

The module is PURE: no DB, no FastAPI. The executor / finalize path reads the
columns and calls ``evaluate_spend_ceilings``; the API layer converts USD
<-> cents at the boundary. Every branch is unit-tested in
``tests/unit/core/test_spend_ceiling.py``.
