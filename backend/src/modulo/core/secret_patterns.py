"""Canonical secret-format VALUE redaction patterns (single source of truth).

The secret-VALUE redaction knowledge — the gitleaks-style
``SECRET_VALUE_PATTERNS`` list and the shared ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_PATTERN`` /
``GITHUB_PAT_PATTERN`` raw patterns — is defined ONCE here so the AWS-key and
fine-grained-GitHub-PAT coverage is never duplicated or drifted across
redaction sites. Agent-output masking (:mod:`modulo.api.routes.runs`) and the
API-layer :mod:`modulo.api.middleware.sensitive_mask` import these names
directly.

Key-NAME masking (matching on config keys such as ``token`` / ``password``)
remains a separate concern owned by each read surface (``error_codes.py``,
``node_runner.py``, ``soc2.py``), because those sites mask by key rather than
by secret value and some run under import-linter contracts that this leaf
module must not pull in.

This module lives in ``modulo.core`` (a leaf with no ``modulo.*`` imports) so
that core redaction sites can use it without violating the
``core-does-not-import-api`` architecture contract. The API-layer
:mod:`modulo.api.middleware.sensitive_mask` re-exports ``SENSITIVE_VALUE_MASK``
so callers in the API layer keep importing from the documented location.
