        (health-check probes, schema-inference, determination scanning) construct
        the hub WITHOUT an ``org_id``: wiring them to Redis would bucket every
        organisation's rate-limited REST connector under a single ``"default"``
        tenant key, sharing ONE budget across distinct orgs (a cross-tenant
        leak). Those short-lived probes stay on the connector-local per-process

        When Redis *is* wired (executor path, ``settings.redis_url`` set and the

        REST connector fall back to its per-process local bucket, silently
        reconstructing the fleet-wide ``N x burst`` fail-open that FAR-439 removed.
        The same fail-closed principle applies to a failure to READ settings: on
        the executor path (``org_id`` present) a ``get_settings()`` failure
        propagates :class:`SharedBudgetUnavailableError` rather than returning
        ``None`` — an executor hub that cannot read its own settings cannot safely
        conclude there is no shared budget. Only the genuinely-not-configured
