"""SuiteRun orchestration — baseline resolution, comparison, spend, notification.

This is the *behaviour* layer for FAR-376 Phase 3. It deliberately REUSES the
existing machinery rather than building a parallel comparison store:

* per-case outcomes are persisted into ``eval_results`` (``suite_run_id`` FK);
* the pass-rate comparison is delegated to ``detect_regressions``
  (``group_by="suite_id"``), reusing its default path unchanged;
* regression/comparison postings route through the existing ``Notifier``
  (``EVENT_EVAL_REGRESSION``), never a parallel "sink" abstraction.

It also owns the two new, pure and testable behaviours:

* the immutable baseline *tuple* (snapshot, never live-looked-up) and the
  deterministic "latest completed same-tuple prior run" baseline resolution;
* the per-``eval_type`` pass-rate aggregation that refuses to cross-combine
  raw ``score`` across differing eval types (type-incorrect).
