"""Shared SSRF-safe URL validation for outbound requests.

Blocks private/link-local/cloud-metadata/CGNAT ranges via DNS resolution.
Loopback is blocked by default but allowlistable: a self-hosted deployment can
opt into localhost model backends and localhost-default connectors (Trivy,
SonarQube, TeamCity, 1Password, Jenkins, n8n, Grafana) by allowlisting the
loopback ranges. Used by notification endpoints, SSO test connections,
observability test, error-forwarder test paths, every ``base_url``-bearing
connector, and the OpenAI-compatible model backends.

Operating ``SSRF_ALLOW_PRIVATE_RANGES``
--------------------------------------
* **Dual-stack loopback needs BOTH entries.** ``localhost`` usually resolves to
  ``127.0.0.1`` *and* ``::1``, and validation fails closed if ANY resolved
  address is blocked. ``SSRF_ALLOW_PRIVATE_RANGES=127.0.0.0/8`` alone therefore
  leaves ``http://localhost:11434`` unreachable — set
  ``SSRF_ALLOW_PRIVATE_RANGES=127.0.0.0/8,::1/128``, or point the URL at the
  literal ``http://127.0.0.1:11434`` (a literal IP skips DNS entirely).
* **The env allowlist is cluster-wide, not per-call-site.** It is read by every
  validation call site, so allowlisting loopback for a localhost model backend
  ALSO lets a tenant-supplied connector ``base_url`` reach loopback on the same
  cluster. Where a narrower grant is wanted, pass ``allow_networks`` (a
  tenant-scoped overlay layered on the global floor) instead of widening the env
  var. Link-local, multicast and cloud-metadata ranges are a non-negotiable
  floor that no allowlist can open.

Accepted residual risks
-----------------------
* **Validate-then-connect (DNS rebinding).** Connectors and model backends call
  :func:`validate_outbound_url` and then connect with their own client, so a
  hostname under attacker DNS control can answer public at validation time and
  internal at connect time. This matches the pre-existing precedent for those
  call sites; the pinned transport below is the strictly safer option and should
  be preferred by new call sites that own their client construction.
* **No resolution cache.** Every validation performs a fresh DNS lookup (bounded
  by ``SSRF_DNS_TIMEOUT``), which costs one resolver round trip per client
  construction on connector-heavy paths. This is deliberate: caching resolutions
  would widen the rebinding window above, and the resolver's own OS-level cache
  already absorbs the repeat cost.

Beyond *validating* a URL, this module owns the **pinned-IP connection
transport**: an ``httpx`` transport that resolves and validates a target once,
then forces the TCP connection to the validated address while keeping the
**original** hostname for TLS SNI and certificate verification. This closes the
DNS-rebinding window that a validate-then-connect pattern leaves open (see the
note on :func:`validate_outbound_url`).

    validators, synchronous call sites). Raises ValueError if the URL is unsafe.

    ``allow_networks`` layers a tenant-scoped CIDR allowlist on top of the
    global ``SSRF_ALLOW_PRIVATE_RANGES`` floor.

    For async callers use :func:`validate_outbound_url_async` so DNS resolution
    does not block the event loop. For callers that actually perform the
    outbound request, use :func:`pinned_async_transport` (or
    :func:`resolve_pinned_ip`) so the validated address is pinned onto the
    connection, closing the DNS-rebinding window described below.

    NOTE — formerly accepted residual risk (DNS rebinding): this validation
    function resolves the hostname, verifies all resolved addresses are
    non-internal, then returns. It does NOT pin the validated address onto the
    subsequent outbound connection. A hostname under DNS control can therefore
    resolve to a public address during validation and to an internal/metadata
    address during the actual request performed by a call site on its own,
    bypassing this check. The pinned transport built here closes that window by
    connecting to the validated address while keeping the original hostname for
    SNI/cert.
