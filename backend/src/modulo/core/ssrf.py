Blocks private/loopback/link-local/cloud-metadata/CGNAT ranges via DNS

Beyond *validating* a URL, this module owns the **pinned-IP connection
transport**: an ``httpx`` transport that resolves and validates a target once,
then forces the TCP connection to the validated address while keeping the
**original** hostname for TLS SNI and certificate verification. This closes the
