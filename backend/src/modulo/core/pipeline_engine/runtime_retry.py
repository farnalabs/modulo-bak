"""Runtime per-node / per-edge retry + compensation execution (FAR-402 P5, §4F).

This module is the RUNTIME sibling of ``retry_compensation`` (the authoring
+ validation layer). It wires the config that P5 validated into ACTUAL
execution by wrapping a node's raw callable so that:

* **per-node retry** (§B): a node body that fails on a retryable event
  (``timeout`` / ``error`` / ``stall``) is re-invoked up to its effective
  ``max_attempts`` with a capped backoff, WITHOUT re-running the rest of the
  graph (LangGraph sees one successful node superstep). The node-scoped
  idempotency key (``run + node + index``, §4F R7) is threaded so a retry can
  dedupe side-effecting re-executions.
* **per-edge retry** (§C): when a target node's OWN retry budget is exhausted
  (or not applicable), an incoming edge that declares a transition ``retry``
  re-executes the SOURCE node (not the target) — the edge-level retry wraps
  node-retry. Fail-closed when the source is ``idempotent=false``.
* **compensation edges** (§E): when a watched node reaches TERMINAL failure and
  an outgoing edge declares an ``on_failure_target``, the wrapper routes to the
  compensation node as a FORWARD execution (no history rewrite). If the
  compensation node succeeds the run CONTINUES (a ``compensated`` marker is
  recorded for observability); if it fails the wrapper raises
  :class:`CompensationFailedError`, which the executor maps to the terminal
  ``COMPENSATION_FAILED`` status.

Configuration source
--------------------
The wrapper never re-implements the P5 resolution rules — it consumes
:mod:`retry_compensation` (``resolve_node_retry`` / ``parse_edge_retry`` /
``edge_retry_reattempts_source`` / ``edge_has_compensation``) so the
authoring-time and run-time vocabularies cannot drift.

Why the retry loop lives HERE (not in the executor stream loop)
---------------------------------------------------------------
LangGraph schedules node callables inside its superstep machinery; the
executor's ``astream_events`` loop only OBSERVES outcomes and has no mechanism
to re-invoke a single node in isolation without replaying the graph from a
checkpoint. Compiling a retry wrapper around each node's raw callable therefore
is the minimal, additive way to deliver within-node re-execution — the
state-graph structure (nodes / edges / entry point) is untouched. This wrapper
is applied at compile time in ``graph_cache`` (see ``build_graph_from_json``).
