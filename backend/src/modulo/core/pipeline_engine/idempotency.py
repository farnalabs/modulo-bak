"""Stable idempotency-key derivation for connector writes (FAR-410).

An operator re-run of an UNKNOWN-terminated connector node must reuse the SAME
persisted idempotency key so a write that may (or may not) have reached the
upstream is not re-applied as a fresh, distinct operation. A key minted from a
fresh random (or from a fresh per-replay ``run_id``) would break that contract.

The key is derived deterministically from a STABLE LOGICAL identity a re-run can
recompute (typically ``<pipeline_id>:<run_number>`` plus the node id and a
cardinality/fanout index). It is never a fresh random per run, and an in-run
retry reuses the identical key.

NOTE (persistence): the derived key is meant to be stored on the run record so
an operator re-run can READ it back. The run-record column
(``runs.idempotency_key``, migration 0156, FAR-438) now lands it: the run stores
its stable logical identity ``<pipeline_id>:<run_number>`` (built + validated in
``modulo.db.crud.run`` — the DB layer owns the run-record storage contract, per
the import-linter layering that forbids ``modulo.db`` importing ``modulo.core``),
and a re-run that restores the SAME run reads it back and recomputes the
identical per-node keys via :func:`node_idempotency_key`. The derivation
primitive (:func:`stable_idempotency_key`) is the delivered contract;
:func:`read_before_write_suppression` is the read-before-write dedupe that
consumes it.

SCOPE (connector-write dedupe, FAR-458): the read-before-write dedupe
(:func:`read_before_write_suppression`) is wired at TWO distinct decision
points:

1. **Sandbox single-node transient recovery** (FAR-438) — the executor's
   ``_idempotency_gate_ok`` reads ``runs.raw_output_markers`` and applies
   suppression for a ``single_sandbox_node`` graph on the sandbox transient
   retry.
2. **Connector-write UNKNOWN recovery** (FAR-458) — the connector node's write
   boundary (``make_connector_fn`` → ``_connector_node``) is now the
   connector-specific decision point: it consults
   :func:`read_before_write_suppression` BEFORE re-sending a write that was
   previously delivered (the persisted ``delivery_done`` marker on the same
   derived key), and stamps a ``delivery_done`` marker when a connector write
   genuinely succeeds. This is the actual FAR-410 scenario this module was
   framed around.

REMAINING GAP (honest, FAR-458): the connector node gate runs at the node level,
one logical write per node invocation, so it threads ``index=None`` and the
write-content ``payload``. A multi-item REST fan-out runs INSIDE the connector
(``write()`` iterates items internally); the node cannot see per-item
cardinality without the connector surfacing it, so per-item fan-out
idempotency-key derivation is NOT wired through the node boundary — it remains
a capability of the primitive (:func:`node_idempotency_key` accepts ``index``).
A future change can thread per-item keys out of the fan-out outcome set.

# node's write boundary (see the SCOPE note in the module docstring). The
# sandbox single-node transient-recovery surface remains wired via the
# executor's ``_idempotency_gate_ok``. Remaining per-item fan-out key threading
# is documented in the SCOPE note as an honest gap. New wiring must keep the
# ``delivery_done is True`` + same-``idempotency_key`` contract — never suppress
# a first-time write or a changed-payload re-run.
#
# FAR-458 refinement (per-connector ``on_unknown``): the CONFIRMED-delivered
# suppression (``delivery_done is True`` + matching key) is mode-independent —
# dedup's whole point. The AMBIGUOUS case — a prior attempt that touched the
# SAME derived key but whose delivery could not be confirmed (``delivery_done``
# absent) — is a SEPARATE decision governed by the per-connector-per-write
# ``on_unknown`` option (:func:`read_before_write_ambiguous`). The per-action
# reasoning: a MISS (fail_closed suppresses a write that might never have
# landed) can be catastrophic for an action that is not self-healing (e.g. a
# one-way email/notification the operator cannot easily re-send), while a
# DUPLICATE (fail_open re-fires an indeterminate write) is usually recoverable
# (a duplicate record can be reconciled/cleaned). Choose fail_closed only when
# a silent miss is the worse outcome (a non-idempotent, hard-to-restore write);
# default is fail_open.

    ``payload`` as the marker write) but WITHOUT ``delivery_done is True`` AND

    prior attempt touched this exact write but its side-effecting delivery could
    not be confirmed. With the FAR-531 intent markers, the ambiguous state is
    carried by an IN-FLIGHT ``connector_write_intent`` marker (persisted after
    the gate proceeds and before the upstream write fires; it is resolved to
    ``delivery_done`` on success or ``no_delivery_confirmed`` on a definite
    failure — a crash/timeout between the two leaves it in-flight, which is
    exactly the ambiguity fail_closed guards against).

    ``no_delivery_confirmed: True`` marks a DEFINITE no-delivery (the connector
    raised, or its result reported failure): the write did NOT reach upstream,

    A first-time write (no marker), a changed-payload/target re-run (derives a
    DIFFERENT key), or a definite-failure re-run (``no_delivery_confirmed``) is
