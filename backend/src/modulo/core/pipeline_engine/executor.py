"""PipelineExecutor — orchestrates a single run end-to-end.

Responsibilities:
  - Seed initial LangGraph state from snapshot.run_context_defaults + input_payload
  - Obtain/compile the StateGraph (via graph_cache)
  - Enforce per-pipeline max_concurrent_runs, the per-org sandbox
    concurrency cap, and the per-org run-concurrency cap via count-based
    capacity checks (no FOR UPDATE; runs declined at capacity are demoted
    back to ``pending`` with a reason marker and recovered by
    ``dispatcher_reconcile`` (cron_helpers) when a slot frees, with
    ``stale_run_recovery_sweep``'s stranded re-dispatch as the durable
    liveness backstop — plan F3b: there is NO in-process retry loop)
  - Consume astream_events() and publish to the per-run RunEventBroker
  - Set up AsyncPostgresSaver as LangGraph checkpointer
  - Stream graph execution, updating Run status on transitions
  - Mark run complete/failed/cancelled/awaiting_human/eval_failed in DB

Handles GraphInterrupt by transitioning the run to awaiting_human.
Does NOT handle WebSocket fan-out, HITL claim/approve/reject, or webhook triggers (phases 3+).

    stream block before this decision runs) is NOT retried. See ``docs/prd.md``
