"""Demo-org seed framework (FAR-450 foundation ticket).

GATED behind ``MODULO_SEED_DEMO_ORGS`` (see ``modulo.settings``). Each demo
organisation carries its OWN signed ``license_key`` in
``Organisation.settings_json`` so it resolves the intended tier (community or
team) via ``core.feature_flags.resolve_plan_context`` — a bare ``plan_id``
without a valid signed license silently downgrades to community, so the
per-org license is mandatory.

This is the FOUNDATION ticket: it builds the framework only. The module-level
``DEMO_ORGS`` list is empty by default; follow-up tickets populate it with
concrete organisations and seed their entities (the ``full`` flag gates which
entities get seeded — ignored for now).
