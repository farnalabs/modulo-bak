"""improve-database: index on dismissals.dismissed_by_user_id.

The only index covering ``dismissed_by_user_id`` is the composite
``uq_dismissal_user_notification(notification_id, dismissed_by_user_id)`` where
it is the second column, so a lookup of all dismissals for a given user
(``WHERE dismissed_by_user_id = ?``) cannot use it. Add a standalone index.

Revision ID: 0152_dismissed_by_user_id_index
