"""Per-org user deactivation: the membership tombstone, not accounts.active.

Revision ID: 0173_per_org_deactivation
Revises: 0172_seed_orphan_organisation
Create Date: 2026-09-02

Why per-org (gh-1794 / FAR-533)
-------------------------------
The caller-bound SECURITY DEFINER ``deactivate_break_glass`` already scoped
its ``org_memberships`` / ``token_families`` / ``org_api_keys`` revocations to
the CALLING admin's organisation in the non-operator branch, but then
unconditionally ran ``UPDATE public.accounts SET active = false`` — an
ACCOUNT-GLOBAL flag flipped on the authorisation basis of a SINGLE shared org.
An admin of org A could therefore lock a shared user out of orgs B/C where
they hold no authority (and ``admin_reactivate_user`` could unlock them
everywhere). The org-membership ``deactivated_at`` tombstone the function
already writes IS the per-org deactivation signal; role resolution, JWT
revalidation and refresh already honour it (ADR 017).

This migration redefines the function (identical signature, identical
authorisation / advisory-lock / last-admin logic) so that:

* the non-operator branch keeps the org-scoped revocations VERBATIM and no
  longer touches ``accounts.active`` — deactivation is per-org;
* the operator / break-glass branch (``session_user = 'modulo_breakglass'``)
  KEEPS the global ``accounts.active = false`` flip — break-glass is a global
  ban by design;
* the M2040 "target does not exist" semantics are preserved in both branches
  (operator branch via ``GET DIAGNOSTICS``/FOUND after the accounts UPDATE as
  before; non-operator branch via an explicit existence check, since the
  accounts UPDATE no longer runs there).

Legacy-data caveat (accepted by Duncan): accounts deactivated under the OLD
global behaviour have ``accounts.active = false`` and stay globally inactive
until an OPERATOR reactivates the account — clearing the membership tombstone
alone cannot restore a globally-flipped account, and this migration
deliberately does NOT back-fill ``accounts.active`` back to true.

# Identical to the 0108 definition EXCEPT the ``UPDATE public.accounts SET
# active = false`` statement (and its M2040 NOT FOUND check) moved inside the
# operator branch, and the non-operator branch gained an equivalent explicit
# M2040 existence check. Non-operator revocations are verbatim from 0108.
