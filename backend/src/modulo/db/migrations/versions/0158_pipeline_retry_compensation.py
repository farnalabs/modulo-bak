"""Register ``compensation_failed``/``unknown`` run statuses + P5 columns (FAR-402 P5).

Revision ID: 0158_pipeline_retry_compensation
Revises: 0157_add_numeric_check_constraints
Create Date: 2026-08-26

Renumber note: this migration was authored as ``0150_pipeline_retry_compensation``
and has been renumbered as main advanced underneath it. It first collided
with main's ``0150_add_router_no_match_status`` (FAR-402 P1 / FAR-415) and was
renumbered to ``0151``; that in turn collided with main's ``0151_fix_constraints``
(improve-database). Main's chain has since grown
``0151_fix_constraints`` -> ``0152_dismissed_by_user_id_index`` ->
``0153_add_numeric_check_constraints`` -> ``0154_add_web_vital_events_time_index``
-> ``0155_add_hot_query_indexes`` -> ``0156_add_soft_delete_partial_uniques`` ->
``0157_add_numeric_check_constraints``. This migration is now numbered ``0158`` and
re-parented onto main's real head ``0157_add_numeric_check_constraints``, keeping
the graph a single linear chain with ``0158`` as the sole head.

Implements the FAR-402 P5 (FAR-419) failure/retry + compensation data-model
deltas:

1. **``runs.idempotency_key``** (nullable String(128)) — the run-level
   idempotency identity of an operator re-run, derived deterministically from
   ``<pipeline_id>:<run_number>`` (FAR-410 primitive, column previously
   deferred). An ``UNKNOWN``-terminated run re-run by an operator reuses the
   SAME persisted key so a write that may have reached the upstream is not
   re-applied as a fresh operation.

2. **``pipeline_edges.retry`` / ``pipeline_edges.on_failure_target``** — a
   transition-edge retry block (re-executes the source node) and a compensation
   node id. Mutually exclusive per failure (design §4F); the graph validator
   enforces the exclusion at compile time.

3. **``ck_runs_status``** — extend the CHECK constraint to admit the two new
   statuses. ``compensation_failed`` is a NEW TERMINAL status (a watched node AND
   its compensation path both failed); ``unknown`` is adopted from FAR-410 as a
   NON-TERMINAL recovery status. Because main's ``0150_add_router_no_match_status``
   (FAR-415) also extends this same constraint (adding ``router_no_match``), the
   recreated list here is the UNION of both migrations' status additions:
   ``router_no_match`` (from main P1) plus ``unknown`` and ``compensation_failed``
   (from this P5). The drop-if-differs / add-if-absent pattern
   (introduced in 0146, mirroring 0110) keeps the migration idempotent and
   rolling-deploy safe — the constraint is rebuilt with a backward-compatible
   SUPERSET so the overlap window where new app code emits a new status while the
   constraint is still the OLD list stays WRITE-SAFE (design §10 O1).
