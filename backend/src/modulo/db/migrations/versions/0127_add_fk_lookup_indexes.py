"""Add missing foreign-key lookup indexes on high-traffic join columns.

Revision ID: 0127_add_fk_lookup_indexes
Revises: 0126_soft_delete_partial_unique
Create Date: 2026-08-23

Several foreign-key columns that are heavily used in JOINs and filter
predicates (runs-for-pipeline, runs-for-account, nodes-for-pipeline,
eval/feedback/trigger/lease-for-run) had no secondary index, forcing
sequential scans on what are core read paths. The ``OrgScoped`` mixin only
indexes ``organisation_id``; these indexes cover the join/lookup keys.

The migration runs inside Alembic's single ``engine.begin()`` transaction
(``env.py`` wraps every revision in one transaction), so the referenced
tables are still uncommitted when this revision executes. A separate
autocommit connection (required by ``CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY``) therefore
cannot see those tables and fails with ``relation "<table>" does not exist``.
``CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`` also cannot run inside a transaction block at
all. We therefore build plain (blocking) ``CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS``
statements on the migration's own connection, which is both visible to the
uncommitted schema and transaction-safe. ``IF NOT EXISTS`` keeps the
migration idempotent and re-runnable.
