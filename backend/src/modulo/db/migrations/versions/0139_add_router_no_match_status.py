"""runs — add ``router_no_match`` to the ``ck_runs_status`` CHECK constraint.

Revision ID: 0139_add_router_no_match_status
Revises: 0147_json_to_jsonb_standardize
Create Date: 2026-08-24

FAR-402 P1 (FAR-415) introduces the ``router_no_match`` terminal run status
emitted when a Router node (F2-A) has no matching rule and no ``default``. The
``ck_runs_status`` CHECK constraint enumerates the allowed status values, so
the new status must be added to it on existing databases. A rolling-deploy
mitigation (design doc Appendix B, O1): the constraint change is additive and
backward-compatible — pre-existing rows never carry the new status, and once
this migration lands the backend may emit it.

The constraint is recreated idempotently: only drop + recreate when the
current definition does not already include ``router_no_match`` (mirrors the
guard pattern used throughout 0110).

Renumber note: this migration was originally ``0138_add_router_no_match_status``
but collided with main's ``0138_eval_versioning``. It is renumbered to
``0139`` and re-parented onto main's head. It was first re-parented onto
``0141_pipeline_edge_ports``; after main advanced to ``0143_rest_connector_profile``
(FAR-412 REST connector profile) the down-revision was updated to ``0143``. After
main advanced again to ``0144_broaden_notification_status_in_app`` (FAR-436) the
down-revision was updated to ``0144`` and then to ``0147_json_to_jsonb_standardize``
after main advanced through 0145/0146/0147. The migration graph stays a single
linear chain with ``0139`` re-parented onto ``0147`` as the head. The recreated
constraint list MUST include ``cost_ceiling_exceeded`` (added by 0146) as well as
``router_no_match`` so this migration does not clobber main's status addition.
