"""CRUD for run data retention (FAR-427) — candidate listing, export, purge.

The backend ``runs`` table is small, but each run's LangGraph state lives in the
``langgraph.*`` checkpoint tables (``checkpoints``, ``checkpoint_blobs``,
``checkpoint_writes``) keyed by ``runs.langgraph_thread_id`` → ``thread_id``.
Those checkpoint rows are never cleaned up by the existing age-based purge
(``crud.run.purge_runs`` / ``batch_delete_old_terminal_runs``), which only deletes
``runs`` rows. Over a month that leaves the DB volume dominated by orphaned
graph checkpoints (observed 2026-08-24: 8.6GB, ~7.8GB of which is checkpoints +
checkpoint_writes), eventually filling the volume.

This module adds the FAR-427 operations:

* ``list_retention_candidates`` — list runs matching a filter set, with an
  ``estimated_bytes`` per run (its own JSON payload columns + its checkpoint
  rows) and a whole-set ``total_estimated_bytes``.
* ``iter_run_export`` — an async generator of JSONL lines (one per run) that
  streams run metadata + full outputs + telemetry + a checkpoint summary. Runs
  in pages so memory stays bounded regardless of how much data the run holds.
* ``purge_terminal_runs`` — delete terminal runs matching a filter set together
  with their checkpoint rows and the related per-run rows. Batched (default 500
  runs per SAVEPOINT), transactional, idempotent, and never touches a
  non-terminal run.

RLS / org scoping: an org-admin passes its ``organisation_id`` so every query and
delete is scoped to that org (the caller also sets ``set_rls_org``). A
system-admin passes ``organisation_id=None`` to operate across all orgs — it
must scope itself manually when it targets a single org. The checkpoint
``thread_id`` encodes ``{org_id}:{run_id}`` (see ``crud.run.create_run``), so it
is globally unique and cross-org deletes never leak.

DELIBERATE NON-DELETION — ``run_daily_facts`` and ``modulo_journey_facts``:
both carry a ``run_id`` that is deliberately NOT a foreign key and must SURVIVE
the run purge (ADR 020; the model comments literally say a future "fix" into an
FK breaks retention). Purging a run therefore leaves those fact rows in place.
Similarly ``cost_components``, ``error_events``, ``token_families`` and
``org_api_keys`` are NOT per-run tables (no ``run_id`` FK) and are untouched.
