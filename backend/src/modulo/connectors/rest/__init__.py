"""RESTConnector — generic verb-agnostic REST integration connector (FAR-408).

A declarative connector that lets a ConnectorInstance declare an arbitrary
HTTP endpoint (URL, method, headers, body, records extraction) and have pipeline
nodes call it with runtime variables rendered into the request. It is the
``ConnectorType.REST`` implementation of the FAR-401 "point Modulo at any
external system" design: no per-vendor client, just a templated HTTP call.

CONFIG SHAPE (``config_json``)
------------------------------
A single connector instance describes ONE endpoint (or a map of named
resources, each with its own endpoint). All template fields are rendered with
Jinja2 (``SandboxedEnvironment`` — the same sandbox ``node_runner`` uses) against
the runtime variables supplied per call:
``ConnectorQuery.filters`` for ``query()`` and ``ConnectorPayload.data`` for
``write()``.

                          }

FAN-OUT / ITERATOR (FAR-411)
---------------------------
When ``fan_out.enabled`` is true and ``fan_out.items_path`` resolves to a
sequence inside the write ``data``, ``write()`` fans out ONE request per item:

* **Sequential emit** — a single code path iterates the items in order, so a
  per-item failure fails the node (no concurrent/bounded-concurrency fork in
  v1).
* **Cardinality guard (fail-closed)** — a Sized source is ``len()``-checked
  BEFORE any request and raises :class:`RESTCardinalityExceededError` with
  zero partial emit. A lazy/unsized generator is buffered up to
  ``max_cardinality + 1`` and then fails before emitting (memory bounded by
  the cap) — an unsized source is NEVER claimed to produce zero partial emit.
* **Empty iterator** — 0 items succeeds vacuously with no calls (an empty
  fan-out is a no-op, not a failure).
* **Per-destination token bucket** — the ONE outbound-call enforcement point.
  Each item consumes a token from a :class:`modulo.connectors._rate_bucket.TokenBucket`
  keyed by host; when empty the call awaits refill. This is **per-process**
  (each uvicorn/SAQ worker owns its own bucket) and **best-effort** — it is
  NOT Redis-backed in this ticket. Note the divergence: existing connectors
  (github, linear, …) have no bucket, so REST is deliberately stricter.
* **Per-item outcome state** — the result carries ``outcomes`` (one record per
  item: index, item, status ``success``/``failure``, result/error), plus
  ``success_count``/``failure_count`` and an explicit ``cardinality_over_cap``
  flag. A mid-fan-out failure raises :class:`RESTFanOutFailureError` carrying
  the outcomes collected so far for operator reconciliation. A durable outbox
  (fire-and-forget mode) is NOT part of v1.
* **Node-budget reconciliation** — ``fan_out.max_cardinality x
  per_item_timeout x (max_retries + 1)`` is reconciled against the node's
  ``timeout_seconds`` budget by the graph validator at save/run time (FAR-411)
  so an oversubscribed fan-out is warned before a run, not discovered mid-run.

VERB-AGNOSTIC READ/WRITE MAPPING
--------------------------------
A REST connector is verb-agnostic, so the capability contract (``read`` /
``write``) maps onto the two public surfaces, not onto any single HTTP verb:

* ``query()`` is the **read** surface — ``_TracedConnector`` calls it with
  ``acl_operation="read"``. It performs the operation's configured verb
  (default ``GET`` ; safe, idempotent verbs make sense here).
* ``write()`` is the **write** surface — ``_TracedConnector`` calls it with
  ``acl_operation="write"``. It performs the operation's configured verb
  (default ``POST`` ; mutable verbs belong here).

A ``PUT`` / ``DELETE`` / ``PATCH`` is neither cleanly read nor write, but it
*mutates* the remote system, so it belongs on the **write** surface (ACL
``write``). The connector does not infer semantics from the verb — the author
declares the method; the surface (query/write) fixes the ACL gate. The
capability set is ``{Capability.READ, Capability.WRITE}``.

AUTH MODES (``credentials_ciphertext`` / ``creds`` dict)
-------------------------------------------------------
Credentials are stored as an ENCRYPTED **JSON dict** (matching the
``secrets_backend`` JSON-dict shape) so multi-field creds round-trip — never the
single ``api_key`` fallback. Read ``auth_mode`` + named fields from that dict:

    auth_mode:  "bearer" | "api_key" | "basic"
    # bearer ->  token
    # api_key -> api_key + header_name (default "X-API-Key") and/or
    #            in: "header" (default) | "query" + query_param_name (default "api_key")
    # basic   -> username + password

Templating uses the existing ``node_runner`` ``jinja2.sandbox.SandboxedEnvironment``;
the only runtime dependencies added here are ``httpx``, ``jinja2`` and
``jmespath``.

TRANSPORT
---------
A single lazily-created, connection-pooled ``httpx.AsyncClient`` is reused
across calls and closed via :meth:`RestConnector.close`. The client never
follows redirects, so HTTP 3xx responses are surfaced as errors (with
``Retry-After``/``location`` metadata) rather than silently passing through.

RETRY
-----
Idempotent verbs (``GET``/``HEAD``) are retried up to 3x with exponential
backoff + jitter, honouring ``Retry-After`` and the retryable status set
(``429``/``5xx``). Mutating verbs are retried only when the operation declares
an ``idempotency_header``. Transport failures are retried for idempotent verbs
and surface as a typed :class:`RESTConnectError`.
