"""OpenTelemetry metrics for the generic REST connector (FAR-413).

Mirrors the ``modulo.core.error_tracking.metrics`` pattern: module-level
handles initialised lazily from the OTel ``get_meter_provider()``, every
operation no-ops when no meter provider is configured or the SDK does not
support an instrument, and every call is exception-swallowed so metrics can
never surface as a connector failure.

UNITS OF BEHAVIOUR
------------------
The cause-code taxonomy is a *stable, closed* set so that a metric consumer
can join it to a released topology without drift. Adding a code is a
semver-visible change; renaming one is forbidden once it ships.

    SUCCESS_OUTCOME = "success"
    CAUSE_3XX       = "http_3xx"       (redirects we refuse to follow)
