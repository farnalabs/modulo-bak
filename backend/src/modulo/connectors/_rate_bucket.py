"""Connector-local per-destination rate limiting buckets (FAR-411 / FAR-439).

The REST connector's per-destination outbound rate limit lives here rather than
reaching into ``modulo.core`` — the import-linter contract forbids connectors
importing core, so ``modulo.core.rate_limiter.TokenBucket`` cannot be reused.
Semantics mirror the core bucket: continuous refill up to ``burst``, guarded by
an ``asyncio.Lock`` so concurrent tasks never go below zero tokens.

FAR-439 adds a SHARED, Redis-backed limiter so a fleet of uvicorn/SAQ workers
enforces ONE budget per destination instead of ``N`` independent per-process
budgets. A destination is keyed per-tenant (``<tenant_id>:<destination>``) where
the destination is the resolved host + path, so different tenants never share a
budget. A SHARED limiter requires a real (non-empty) ``tenant_id`` — passing a
``redis_client`` without one raises, because silently coercing to ``"default"``
would funnel every organisation into a single cross-tenant Redis budget. The
shared limiter composes with the local bucket:

* **Redis available** — every worker acquires a token through a single atomic
  Redis token bucket (a Lua script), so concurrent workers across the fleet can
  never over-spend the shared budget (no lost-token race).
* **Redis NOT configured** (``redis_client=None``) — the connector-local
  :class:`TokenBucket` is authoritative. This is the single-worker-dev /
  no-fleet case, where there is no shared budget to multiply, so a per-process
  bucket is correct.

REMOVED FAIL-OPEN FALLBACK (FAR-439 follow-up):

When a ``redis_client`` **is** configured (a multi-worker fleet sharing one
budget is the *point*), a Redis failure must NOT fall back to each worker's own
per-process bucket — that would silently multiply the effective cap by the
worker count (``N x burst``), defeating the single-budget guarantee. The limiter
is therefore **fail-closed** when Redis is configured but unavailable:

* a single transient failure is **retried once** (the shared charge is re-issued
  against the SAME Redis budget — never a second, uncounted budget);
* if the retry also fails, :class:`SharedBudgetUnavailableError` is raised and a
  prominent ``rest.rate_limit.degraded`` warning is emitted, so the request is
  NOT sent on a budget we cannot account for and an operator sees the degrade
  window. We deliberately do NOT mint from a per-process bucket here — the whole
  point of a quota-correctness limiter is one shared budget.

The ``rest.rate_limit.degraded`` signal is the honest aggregate-cap alert: it
fires exactly once per outage episode where consumption crosses from the shared
Redis budget into fail-closed, making the window visible without flooding per
request.

Saturation is surfaced as a monotonically increasing counter plus a structured
log. To avoid alert flooding, the ``rest.rate_limit.saturated`` WARNING is
emitted only on a deny-after-grant transition (or the first deny for a fresh
destination); subsequent back-to-back denies still increment the counters but do
not re-emit the level — the counters are the metric, the log is the alarm.
