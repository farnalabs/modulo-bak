"""Shared HTTP retry-header parsing for connector clients.

The connector modules (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Linear, Slack) each implement the
same ``Retry-After`` / rate-limit-reset parsing with per-provider header-name
differences. Keeping the logic in one place avoids drift between the copies
while letting each connector pass its own rate-limit header names.

FAR-410 promotes the retryable-status intersection into a single shared
constant and adds the REST retry semantics (response-code x effect matrix,
``Retry-After`` HTTP-date parsing, split-budget cancellation classification and
per-attempt timeout sizing) that the generic REST connector (FAR-401) composes
with the executor's ``asyncio.wait_for`` budget.
