# Product Map

The product map is the single inventory of every shipped feature in Modulo. It has two
layers:

1. **`frontend/src/manifest.yaml`** — the machine-readable product surface (ADR 008 — Core
   Shared Manifest). It registers every UI route, its `product_map: [feat-*]` references,
   sidebar grouping, permissions/tiers, testable `data-testid` elements, and the
   `features:` registry of allowed feature ids. The backend serves it at
   `/api/v1/manifest`, the frontend router/nav consume it at build time, and Remy's
   `search_documentation` indexes each route's `product_map` refs.
2. **`docs/product-map/`** — the feature graph (this directory). One behaviour-tracker
   entry per feature, keyed by the same `feat-*` id, describing expected behaviours,
   happy paths, error semantics, coverage, and known gaps. Entries are the human-readable
   layer on top of the manifest registry.

This file is the graph root. Entries are nodes; the frontmatter fields are typed edges.

## Source of truth

`frontend/src/manifest.yaml` **must never shrink** the `features:` registry without
reason: every registered feature is referenced by at least one shipped route, and every
`feat-*` reference anywhere in the codebase must resolve either to a registered manifest
feature or to a behaviour-tracker entry below (enforced by
`backend/tests/architecture/test_product_map.py`). If a feature ships, it appears in one
of these two places — otherwise it is invisible to Remy and to this graph.

## Entry format

```markdown
---
id: feat-<domain>-<feature>        # unique feature id (match the manifest registry)
prd: N.N                           # PRD section (N/A for infra-only surfaces)
adr: [docs/adr/...md]              # governing ADRs (optional)
code: [backend/src/...]            # code paths implementing this feature
bdd: [tests/.../feature]           # BDD feature files (missing = coverage gap)
unit-tests: [tests/...]            # unit/integration test files
delivery-tasks: [task-...]         # delivery-plan task ids
depends-on: [feat-...]             # prerequisite features
status: covered | partial | gap    # coverage status of the behaviours below
---

# <Feature Name>

<One-paragraph summary of what the feature is and who uses it.>

## Behaviours

- [x] every shipped behaviour, checked once verified against code + tests
- [ ] unchecked = genuine gap (moved to Known Gaps when acknowledged)

## Known Gaps

Bulleted, concrete gaps that are consciously not shipped or not covered.

## QA History

Dated audit notes: what was verified, when, and by which pass.
```

The node id in a feature-graph entry is the `feat-*` id (e.g. `feat-infra-health`).
Infra-only surfaces that have no UI route are tracked **here**, not in the manifest
`features:` registry — the manifest registry is for route-referenced product features.

## Contribution workflow

For **any** feature change (new feature, changed behaviour, deprecated behaviour):

1. Update the manifest: add/update the route's `product_map` references and keep the
   `features:` registry description accurate (`frontend/src/manifest.yaml`).
2. Update the behaviour-tracker entry in this directory (`docs/product-map/`) — tick
   verified behaviours, add tests to `code:`/`unit-tests:`/`bdd:`, and note new known
   gaps. If the change adds a genuinely new feature, create a new entry here **and**
   register it in `features:` (unless it is an infra-only surface with no UI route).
3. Run the architecture suite so the graph stays consistent:
   `uv run --project backend --no-sync pytest backend/tests/architecture/test_product_map*.py -q`
4. Update the PRD if the change introduces new behaviour (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
