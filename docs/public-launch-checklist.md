- [ ] `MODULO_LOG_LEVEL` is set to `INFO` (not `DEBUG`)
- [ ] `MODULO_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` is set appropriately for data residency requirements
- [ ] `MODULO_USERS` uses bcrypt-hashed passwords and is **not** committed to git

---

## 3. Security

- [ ] **CSRF protection** enabled on all state-changing endpoints
- [ ] **Row-Level Security** is enabled on all tenant-scoped tables
  - RLS test suite passes: `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_rls.py -v`
- [ ] **Secrets** are injected via environment, not hardcoded in any file or committed to git
- [ ] **Container images** have zero critical/high CVEs (Trivy scan)
- [ ] **Containers** run as non-root user
- [ ] **Read-only root filesystem** enabled for backend containers
- [ ] **Firewall** blocks all inbound ports except 443 (HTTPS)
- [ ] **Network egress** is restricted to known endpoints (see [`docs/deployment/vpc-checklist.md`](./deployment/vpc-checklist.md))
- [ ] **`SECURITY.md`** exists at the repo root with contact and disclosure policy

See [`docs/deployment-security.md`](./deployment-security.md) for the full security hardening guide.

---

## 4. Observability

- [ ] **Health endpoint** (`/health` or `/healthz`) is reachable and returns 200
- [ ] **OpenTelemetry** is configured (if desired) with `MODULO_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true`
- [ ] **Grafana** dashboards are loaded (optional):
  - Pipeline performance
  - HITL review activity
  - Cost tracking
- [ ] **Audit log chain** integrity is verified (`GET /api/v1/admin/audit/verify`; requires `audit.manage`, no CLI wrapper)
- [ ] **Log retention** is configured:
  - Application logs: 30 days minimum
  - Audit logs: append-only table (`audit_events`); not purged automatically
- [ ] **Alerts** are configured for:
  - Rate limit threshold exceeded (>5% 429s)
  - Audit chain integrity failure
  - Failed login rate spike (>10/min per IP)
  - Migration failure (crash loop)
  - Container image with Critical CVE

---

## 5. Backup & Disaster Recovery

- [ ] **Automated daily backups** are configured:
  ```cron
  0 2 * * * cd /opt/modulo/codebase && uv run scripts/backup.py --output /backups/daily/$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).tar.gz.enc
  ```
- [ ] **Backup encryption passphrase** is 32+ characters and stored separately from the backup
- [ ] **Backup retention** is configured (7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly)
- [ ] **Restore procedure** is tested:
  ```bash
  uv run scripts/restore.py --input /backups/latest.tar.gz.enc --dry-run
  ```
- [ ] **Disaster recovery plan** is documented (see [`docs/operations/backup.md`](./operations/backup.md) §Disaster Recovery Guide)
- [ ] **`FERNET_KEY` backup copy** is stored in a separate vault/password manager
- [ ] **Postgres WAL archiving** is configured (optional, for point-in-time recovery)

---

## 6. Deployment Configuration
