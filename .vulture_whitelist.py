# Vulture whitelist: framework-required symbols that vulture cannot resolve.
#
# These are NOT dead code in the sense the gate exists to catch — removing them
# breaks framework contracts, OR they are genuinely dead in production but
# referenced by tests (which we never delete). Each entry carries a comment
# grouping it by contract. Static analysis (vulture) reports them as dead
# while they are in fact load-bearing or test-referenced.
#
# Mechanism: vulture's documented whitelist is a Python file passed as an
# additional PATH argument. Names reach vulture's `used_names` set (which is
# what suppresses "unused" reports) when the whitelist module declares them in
# an `__all__` list — vulture special-cases `__all__ = [...]` in visit_Assign
# and adds every string element to used_names. A plain `ignored = [...]` list
# does NOT suppress anything; only `__all__` (or bare Load references) does.
# (Verified empirically against vulture 2.16: stub `def`/`class` definitions
# do NOT suppress findings — they only enter defined_funcs/defined_classes.)
#
# The names are intentionally undefined here (they exist in backend/src) —
# that is the whole point of a whitelist — so suppress ruff's F822 for this
# file. RUF022 (__all__ not sorted) is also suppressed: the entries are
# deliberately grouped by contract category (see the section comments), not
# sorted alphabetically, and an isort-style sort would interleave the
# categories and destroy the grouping. This file lives at the repo root,
# outside the backend/ ruff scan scope; the directive only protects against a
# future root-level lint.
# ruff: noqa: F822, RUF022
